# AdditionalNote

This is an additional note that has a duplicate filename in the `SubFolder` subdirectory. We can still link to the other [AdditionalNote](obsidian/TestPages/AdditionalNote.md). 

As per the norm set on  [C2](https://wiki.c2.com/), Obsidian filenames are no-space [CamelCase](https://wiki.c2.com/?CamelCase).
