# Post-AP assignment: Java Collections Framework

After the APCS A (Java)  Examination, there are often 3-5 weeks left in the semester (especially for non-seniors) &mdash; depending on when the examination is scheduled and snow days.

The [Java Collections Framework](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/overview.html) is a '&hellip;unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections' that goes beyond primitive arrays. It can form the introductory basis of a second-semester college data structures course. As such, it is a valuable introduction to what computing majors will see in their first year of post-secondary education.
# Assignment

The assignments are to use minimal versions of the `Collection` and `List` interfaces to:

- implement a minimal version of `LinkedList` and extend it to implement minimal versions of `Queue` and `Stack`.;
- implement `Set` using an underlying `List`, then implement `HashSet` using an array as a [hash table](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/), then implement `TreeSet` as a [binary search tree](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/). (`Set`s also form the basis of various [associative array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) data structures.)

These assignments allow exploration of implementation tradeoffs, an understanding of when each data structure is appropriate for use, and real experience coding methods that users might otherwise take for granted.

Follow the specifications in the *Java Collections Framework* document and complete the four [Codecheck.it](https://horstmann.com/codecheck/) assignments, submitting the downloaded .ZIP files.
