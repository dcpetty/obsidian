# Teaching with & about AI

This *[Punnett Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square) for teaching AI* collects four possible crosses: *with AI* vs. *about AI* and *for students* vs. *for teachers*.

|Teaching&hellip;|**With AI**|**About AI**|
|---|---|---|
|*&hellip;for students*|
**Teaching *with* AI often focuses on using tools** at the expense of learning *about* AI &mdash; including citizenship and ethics, which are often an afterthought to a technical unit.|**Teaching *about* AI can focus on ML techniques, math, or the use of libraries &amp; models** &mdash; without enough emphasis on critical AI policies, ethics, and applications to ensure a hopeful 'possible future.'|
|*&hellip;for teachers*|**Educators using AI often focus on using tools to assist in their teaching**, without appreciating the quirks and limitations of the systems they use.|**Educators don't always have a complete understanding *about* AI**, beyond content they teach to students. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of types of AI, ethical principles, and policies relating to AI are as important for teachers to consider as they are for students.|
