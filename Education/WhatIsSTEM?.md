# What is STEM?

<code style="color: red; font-variant: small-caps;">This note is a DRAFT</span>

[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM) an acronym for *science, technology, engineering, and mathematics*. Sometimes an '*A*' is added to include *arts* in [STE(A)M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields). 

As with most buzzwords, it has come to mean whatever people want it to mean.

- An emphasis on science and math
- Filling the STEM pipeline for jobs
- Two thirds of the disciplines for which there are state or national standards
- A convenient shorthand
- Yet one more way to overload the definition of _technology_

STE(A)M is a convenient acronym to group subject areas and career paths, it does not get at the essence of what I believe important about STE(A)M teaching and learning.

## What is STEM education?

*<span style="color: red;">In contrast to most content-based definitions of STEM, this manifesto emphatically asserts that **the definition of STEM teaching and learning must incorporate four things**</span>*.

- **Cross-curricular teaching and learning** — analyze synthesize different disciplines
- **Asking and answering open-ended questions** — four of the seven *[Gold Standard PBL: Essential Project Design Elements](https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl/gold-standard-project-design)* of PBLWorks and the Buck Institute for Education.
- **An iterative design process** — 
- **Making something** — creation is one of the [7 Big Ideas](https://bit.ly/7-big-ideas) of computer science: '[Computing is a creative human activity&hellip;]()https://arc.net/l/quote/ifgjltlu)' and one of the  [7 Core Practices](https://k12cs.org/); important part of PBL

## What STEM is _not_

- IT / ET
- Only one of the STEM disciplines

## Why STEM?

- The usual suspects
- A focus on the three things students miss from book-learning
- Engineering as a missing aspect of K-12 education

## Additional points…

- How do [common core](http://corestandards.org/) and [next generation](http://nextgenscience.org/) standards affect what we do?
- Where does [computer science](http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html) fit in?
- What about other disciplines? Art? Humanities?
