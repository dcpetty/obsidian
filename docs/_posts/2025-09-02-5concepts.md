[Programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) are the means through which humans (and other computers) can express ideas in ways *they* understand to communicate them to computers in ways *they* understand.

[Programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) are translated from a human-intelligible form to a computer-intelligible form &mdash; usually by means of a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) or [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29).

To understand how to communicate with a computer through programming, neophytes and beginning students must master *Five programming-language concepts that (mostly) all programming languages (mostly) share*.

## Concepts

- **Sequence** — The concept that [serial computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_computer) that understand [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) execute instructions in a sequence of statements that change a program's state. A *sequence* is one of the [structured programming control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming#Control_structures). A recipe is an analog of a *sequence*.
- **Selection** — The concept that computers can execute one of a number of statements  depending on a program's state. A *selection* is one of the [structured programming control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming#Control_structures). A *selection* can be referred to as a *conditional (statement)* and is often represented by two mutually-exclusive sequence paths chosen based on a [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) (`true` or `false`) value. A common *selection* is an [`if`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)#If%E2%80%94then(%E2%80%94else)) statement.
- **Iteration** — The concept that computers can repeatedly execute instructions based on programmatic criteria (until operations have been applied to every element of a collection or the program reaches a certain state). *Iteration* is one of the [structured programming control structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming#Control_structures). An *iteration* can be referred to as a *loop*. Common *iteration*s are [`for` (count-controlled loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_loop) and [`while` (condition-controlled loop)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop) statements.
- **Functions** — The concept that many instructions can be [abstracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_%28computer_science%29) into a single statement that can be invoked multiple times. The [flow of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) in a computer program is transferred to *non-local* instructions when a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28computer_programming%29) is invoked (after which the flow of control usually [returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_statement) to the *sequence* in the program just after the [*function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28computer_programming%29) was invoked) &mdash; as opposed to the [flow of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) being transferred only to *local* instructions in *sequence*, *selection*, and *iteration*. [Mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29) are analogs of programming [*function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28computer_programming%29)s.
- **Variables** — The concept that named locations within a computer can be given values representing the [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28computer_science%29) of a program that can be: remembered from instruction to instruction, be retrieved, and be modified. A [*variable*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_%28computer_science%29) varies, in that its value can change &mdash; *variable*s in programming superficially resemble, but may not directly correspond to the concept of variables in mathematics.
> Note: in [*declarative programming*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) programs do not typically have side effects (mutable system state stored in variables). [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), for example, aims to minimize or eliminate side effects. The *five programming-language concepts* described here are for typical [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) languages.
