[STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM) an acronym for *science, technology, engineering, and mathematics*. Sometimes an '*A*' is added to include *arts* in [STE(A)M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEAM_fields).

As with most buzzwords, it has come to mean whatever people want it to mean.

- An emphasis on science and math
- Filling the STEM pipeline for jobs
- Two thirds of the disciplines for which there are state or national standards
- A convenient shorthand
- Yet one more way to overload the definition of _technology_

STE(A)M is a convenient acronym to group subject areas and career paths &mdash; it does not get at the essence of what I believe is important about STE(A)M teaching and learning.

## What is STEM education?

*<span style="color: red;">In contrast to most content-based definitions of STEM, this manifesto emphatically asserts that **the definition of STEM teaching and learning must incorporate four things**</span>*.

- **Cross-curricular teaching and learning** &mdash; The tendency to silo educational content (especially in secondary grades) is antithetical to students [analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy) what they learn. If STEM teaching and learning is anything, it embodies resistance to this tendency. Specialization is best left to advanced study in post-secondary or graduate courses &mdash; when deep dives are necessary.
- **Asking and answering open-ended questions** &mdash; Four of the seven *[Gold Standard PBL: Essential Project Design Elements](https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl/gold-standard-project-design)* of PBLWorks (and the Buck Institute for Education) are embodied in *authentic, challenging problems that include student voice in posing, as well as answering, questions through sustained inquiry*. This approach is the antithesis of a hand-holding or demonstration-based approach that purports to know the outcome of an activity before it starts. The educators' challenge is to support students through the process.
- **An iterative design process** &mdash; The [engineering design process](https://chat.openai.com/share/35e53052-72c5-4cbb-8214-9e1e8f641aa0) &mdash; which is akin to the *artistic design process* and the *scientific method* &mdash; is described in many ways, each including what authors deem are relevant steps and sub-steps. They include as their basis: Imagine &#x2192; Design &#x2192; Build &#x2192; Test &#x21ba; &mdash; with the important step of iterating the process when things don't work as expected. Learning from 'failure' (a loaded word for students) and developing the resilience to try-try-again is an important aspect of K12 engineering education &mdash; and a reason it is one of four strands in the *[Massachusetts  Science and Technology / Engineering Curriculum Framework(2016)](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/scitech/2016-04.pdf#page=145)*.
- **Making something** &mdash; Creation is one of the [7 Big Ideas](https://bit.ly/7-big-ideas) of computer science: '[Computing is a creative human activity&hellip;](https://arc.net/l/quote/ifgjltlu)' (defined as part of the *[CS Principles](https://web.archive.org/web/20121013163639/http://www.csprinciples.org/home/about-the-project)* project in 2010). *[Creativity](https://arc.net/l/quote/xhnxbadg)* has its colloquial meaning of 'produce or use original and unusual ideas.' It also means 'the process of creating.' Both important meanings are supported by students generating *public products* (one of the [7 essential elements of PBL](https://www.pblworks.org/what-is-pbl/gold-standard-project-design)) or *creating computational artifacts* (one of the  [7 Core Practices](https://k12cs.org/) of the *K-12 Computer Science Frameworks*). *Making stuff* requires students to 'think outside the box' as well as collaborate in creating something for their community to reflect upon, critique, and revise.

Teaching and learning that incorporates these [four elements](#what-is-stem-education) is what STEM education is to me.

## What STEM is _not_

STEM teaching and learning can be many things. Some STEM trends must be avoided.

- *Technology* (from the Greek [τέχνη](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne)) is an overloaded word. It can mean anything from a tool like a pencil to elaborate human-made systems like [generative artificial intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/share/642a8ca5-0bf3-4323-b61f-70dd324755d3). Too often 'technology' is taken as a synonym or shorthand for STEM &mdash; as in 'information technology' (IT) or 'educational technology' (ET). These terms refer to tool *using*, whereas STEM is much more about tool *making.* **STEM must not be conflated with IT or ET.**
- Since STEM is an acronym, it is too often used as a synonym or shorthand for only one of its core content areas &mdash; as in 'I'm a math teacher... I teach STEM' or 'I'm a science teacher... I teach STEM.' **STEM must resist the tendency to siloing.**
- STEM is a popular shorthand for career pathways that lead to 'good paying jobs' or as an educational focus whose lack is something to [decry](https://arc.net/l/quote/tsdixamg), lest we be 'left behind.' While STEM is touted as the key to *[future-ready skills](https://openlearning.mit.edu/news/learn-future-ready-skills-enhance-your-career-2023)*, the habits of mind engendered by the [four elements](#what-is-stem-education) of STEM teaching and learning are more important that any specific content knowledge. **STEM must not be justified solely by its usefulness to careers of the moment.**

## Why STEM?

- After challenging the conventional definition of STEM, it is important to acknowledge that studying STEM content disciplines K-12 *does* help prepare students for advanced study and careers in STEM-adjacent disciplines; those disciplines *are* often well compensated and intellectually rewarding; and excelling in those disciplines *is* a requirement to tackle and solve the biggest challenges facing humanity &mdash; like the [climate catastrophe](https://rebellion.global/) and [artificial intelligence](https://ai100.stanford.edu/gathering-strength-gathering-storms-one-hundred-year-study-artificial-intelligence-ai100-2021-1-0). ([Also](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/06/02/the-15-biggest-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/)&hellip;).
- STEM teaching and learning exposes students to [four](#what-is-stem-education) things they typically do not get from traditional 'book learning.' It requires atypical approaches to instruction, assignments and activities, and assessments and grading. Approaches that incorporate the *[DLCS Practices](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/dlcs.pdf#page=17)* of connecting, creating, abstracting, analyzing, communicating, collaborating, and research.
- STEM disciplines typically have overrepresentation by White and Asian male students and professionals. It is therefore *vital* for reasons of equity that students from underrepresented groups &mdash; especially Black, Brown, and female students &mdash; are exposed to the STEM teaching and learning described in this [manifesto](#what-is-stem-education) at every grade level K-12. *It is especially vital that grade K-5 students have access to all [four](#what-is-stem-education)  elements of STEM education and that the middle grades 6-8 exploratory courses provide an '**on ramp**' to grade 9-12 integrated STEM units and stand-alone elective courses.*
- Engineering &mdash; as opposed to [science](https://blog.eie.org/4-simple-ways-to-explain-the-difference-between-science-and-engineering) &mdash; is not typically included in K-12 STEM curricula. Engineering is the *application* of knowledge in order to solve problems. Even though the engineering design process is structurally similar to the scientific method, engineering is fundamentally about solving problems that humans face &mdash; not fundamentally about the pursuit of knowledge. The multi-disciplinary engineering problem-solving approach embodies STEM.
- STEM problem-solving &mdash; especially as it relates to computing education &mdash; is typified by *computational thinking*. Originally described in detail by Jeannette Wing ([2006](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf)) and expanded upon by Fred Martin ([2018](https://advocate.csteachers.org/2018/02/17/rethinking-computational-thinking/)): '*computational thinking is about connecting computing to things in the real world*' and '*&hellip;is the "connecting tissue" between the world of computer science / programming expertise and the world of disciplinary knowledge*.' This connection is a fundamental aspect of STEM problem-solving and what enables,  '*&hellip;formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by&hellip;*' code and computers ([2010](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~CompThink/resources/TheLinkWing.pdf)).

## Other questions…

- How do [common core](http://corestandards.org/) and [next generation](http://nextgenscience.org/) standards affect what we do? Are there crosswalks for these national and state standards with [K–12 Computer Science](https://k12cs.org/) and [DLCS](https://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/dlcs.pdf) curriculum frameworks — especially since many non-computing curricula already incorporate computing standard and practices?
- What about other disciplines? Art? Humanities? What about units integrated in topics or courses from non-computing disciplines?
