An introductory course in [https://python.org/](https://python.org/) should result in learners knowing and being proficient in these six concepts.

1. **Introduction**: basics of Python / tools / modules<br>Including installing and using Python (and pre-3.6 and post-3.8 version differences), use of VSCode in various scenarios, `import`ing modules, and using (and writing) documentation.
1. **Expressions**: data types / variables / calculations<br>Including using variables of various types in arithmetic calculations, including the `math` module.
1. **Selection**: logic / conditionals<br>Including [comparisons](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons)  `and`, `or`, `not`, and `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.
1. **Iteration**: for and while loops / iterative data<br>Including `while` and `for` statements.
1. **Functions**: definition / parameters / return values / composition<br>Including `def`, [`docstring`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)s, parameters (positional, default, keyword, arbitrary positional, arbitrary keyword) vs. arguments, return values, and invocation / composition.
1. **Data Structures**: lists / sets / dictionaries / files (including .CSV) / nested data structures<br>Including [sequence types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range), [set types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset), and [mapping types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict) and working with files.
